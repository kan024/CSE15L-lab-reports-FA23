## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
> 1. The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don’t actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)

**Student:** Hello TA, I am having a hard time debugging my code. The `capital` method of my code takes two lists of string charaters and returns all the ones that has capital 
letters in them. It was able to correctly return the list containing `"X"`  when I gave my `capital` method the lists `"X"` and `"a"`

**TA:** Hmm that is strange. What does the error output in the terminal say?

**Student:** it says "array lengths differed, expected.length=2 actual.length=1; arrays first differed at element [1]; expected:<C> but was:<end of array>" I think this 
means that the length of the array I expected from it is different from the length of the array my `capital` methods gives me.

> 2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)

**TA:** What do you think that means? Is your code `capital` not returning enough items? Or is your code `capital` returning the wrong things?

**Student:** I think my code is not returning enough items. It was able to discern `"X"` is a capital letter and  `"a"` is not a capital letter. 

**TA:** How are you checking for capital letters in your method `capital`? What methods are you using? 

**Student:** I am iterating through every string in list one using  `(letter.equals(letter.toUpperCase()))`. If a letter in list 1 equals the upper cased version of that letter, it is added to an empty array list.

**TA:** Is the `capital` method supposed to iterate over one list or 2 lists?

**Student:** The `capital` method is supposed to iterate over two lists, meaning list1 and list 2. Not just list 1

> 3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.

The student is now iterating over list1 and list2 instead of just list1. They are now able to pass both tests because the length and content of their expected and their result are the same. The bug in this case was a bug that showed `capital` method gave the wrong output, because they were adding the capital letters of `list1` to the list of returned capital letters and not `list2`

> *The contents of each file before fixing the bug  

The file `ListExamples.java` before the bug fix. This file is able to take in two string lists of characters, and return a single list of all capital letter lists in both the lists.

This is the test file that tests if `ListExamples.java`  is able to correctly return the capital letters.

> *The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug

The line that triggered the bug was `assertArrayEquals(new String[]{ "A", "C" }, ListExamples.capital(l1, l2).toArray());` which is line 19 of `ListExamplesTests.java`. This triggered the bug because the expected array list `"A", "C"`, which had a length of two did not match up with the result `ListExamples.capital(l1, l2).toArray()` which had a length of one. This caused the `assertArrayEquals` line to fail.
