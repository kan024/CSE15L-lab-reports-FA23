**Part 1 – Debugging Scenario**

sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don’t actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)

**Student:** Hello TA, I am having a hard time debugging my code. The `capital` method of my code takes two lists of string charaters and returns all the ones that has capital 
letters in them. It was able to correctly return the list containing `"X"`  when I have them `"X"` for list one and `"a"` for list two in one test, but not the other. 

**TA:** Hmm that is strange. What does the error say?

**Student:** it says "array lengths differed, expected.length=2 actual.length=1; arrays first differed at element [1]; expected:<C> but was:<end of array>" I think this 
means that the length of the array I expected from it is different from the length of the array my `capital` methods gives me. 

A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)
