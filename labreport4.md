**5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)**
Once I was logged into the terminal, I was prompted to type the next xommand. I had previously copied the ssh link from the github link. I right clicked on my mouse, which is the command to paste something into vs code terminal. Once it was pasted I pressed `enter`
