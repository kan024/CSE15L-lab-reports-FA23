- The working directory is lecture1
- The output changed the terminal name meaning we did successfully change the directory
- The output is not an error, because we successfully changed directories

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
![cd1](image3.png)
- The working directory is messages
- The output 'not a directory' occured because the file I wanted to go to was not a directory. Somehow it went to messages as the directory, likely because it is the closest
- This is an input error, because the file is not a directory.
