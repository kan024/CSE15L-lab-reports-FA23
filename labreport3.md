__Explanation 1__

The `find -size` command searches for files that are more, less than, or equal the size we give. `$ find technical/plos -size +20k` in this case finds all files in `technical`'s directory `plos` that is greater than 20 kilobytes. We search greater because of the `+20k` part of the command. This is useful if we are trying locate and delete files over a certain size, or if we are trying to categorize files by size. 

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main) `$ find technical/biomed -size -30k`

__Output 2__

technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-22.txt`

__Explanation 2__
The `find -size` command searches for files that are more, less than, or equal the size we give. `$ find technical/plos -size -30k` in this case finds all files in `technical`'s directory `plos` that is less than 30 kilobytes. We search less because of the `-20k` part of the command. This is useful if we are trying locate and delete files over a certain size, or if we are trying to categorize files by size. 

__2. Find -Type__

__Command 1__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/ -type d`

__Output 1__

`technical/
technical/911report
technical/biomed
technical/government
technical/government/About_LSC
technical/government/Alcohol_Problems
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office
technical/government/Media
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm
technical/plos`

__Explanation 1__

The `find type` command searches for the type of item listed in the directory. In this case `find -type d` finds and lists all the directories in the directory `technical/` because the `-type d` searches and lists directories. This is relevant in case we are searching for certain subdirectories in a directory. This can also be relevant if you want to count how many subdirectories are in a directory

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/government -type f`

__Explanation 2__

The `find -type` command searches for the type of item listed in the directory. In this case `find -type f` finds and lists all files found in 'technical/government` because the `-type f` searches and lists files. This is relevant in case we are searching for certain files in a directory that are regular files. 

__3. Find -mtime__

__Command 1__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/biomed -mtime -7`

__Output 1__

`technical/biomed

technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-13.txt
technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-16.txt`

__Explanation 1__

The `find -mtime` command searches for files based on when they were last modified. In this case the `-mtime -7` part of the command searches for files that were modified in the last seven days. This is helpful if you are looking for a file you recently modified, or looking for a files you modified a certain number of days ago. 

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/biomed -mtime 0`

__Output 2__
`technical/biomed
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt`

__Explanation 2__

The `find -mtime` command searches for files based on when they were last modified. In this case the `-mtime 0` part of the command searches for files that were modified in the last  day. This is helpful if you are looking for a file you recently modified, or looking for a files you modified a certain number of days ago.
