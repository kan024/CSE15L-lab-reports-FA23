- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)


- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
- nThe symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
- Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

__Explanation 1__
The `find -size` command searches for files that are more, less than, or equal the size we give. `$ find technical/plos -size +20k` in this case finds all files in `technical`'s directory `plos` that is greater than 20 kilobytes. We search greater because of the `+20k` part of the command. This is useful if we are trying locate and delete files over a certain size, or if we are trying to categorize files by size.
