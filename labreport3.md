__Part 1__
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

``` java
@Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3 };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3,2,1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
``` java
	@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
```
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

![cd1](piclab3.png)
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
``` java
//buggy code
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
``` java
//fixed code
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < (arr.length/2); i ++) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }
```
``` java
//buggy code
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
``` java
//fixed code
    static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    int index = 0;
    for(int i = arr.length-1; i > -1; i --) {
      newArray[index] = arr[i];
      index++;
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```
- Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
The ` reverseInPlace(int[] arr)` method returns the same array it started with instead of the reverse. The new code reverses only the first half ofthe array so that it properly reverses thearray instead of looping through the entirety. The `reversed(int[] arr)`method returns the same array it started with, instead of a new reversed array. The fix made a new array `newArray` with the reversed contents of the original and properly returned the new array.

technical/plos/pmed.0020162.txt`

__Explanation 1__

The `find -size` command searches for files that are more, less than, or equal the size we give. `$ find technical/plos -size +20k` in this case finds all files in `technical`'s directory `plos` that is greater than 20 kilobytes. We search greater because of the `+20k` part of the command. This is useful if we are trying locate and delete files over a certain size, or if we are trying to categorize files by size. 

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main) `$ find technical/biomed -size -30k`

__Output 2__

technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-12.txt
technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-22.txt`

__Explanation 2__
The `find -size` command searches for files that are more, less than, or equal the size we give. `$ find technical/plos -size -30k` in this case finds all files in `technical`'s directory `plos` that is less than 30 kilobytes. We search less because of the `-20k` part of the command. This is useful if we are trying locate and delete files over a certain size, or if we are trying to categorize files by size. 

__2. Find -Type__

__Command 1__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/ -type d`

__Output 1__

`technical/
technical/911report
technical/biomed
technical/government
technical/government/About_LSC
technical/government/Alcohol_Problems
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office
technical/government/Media
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm
technical/plos`

__Explanation 1__

The `find type` command searches for the type of item listed in the directory. In this case `find -type d` finds and lists all the directories in the directory `technical/` because the `-type d` searches and lists directories. This is relevant in case we are searching for certain subdirectories in a directory. This can also be relevant if you want to count how many subdirectories are in a directory

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/government -type f`

technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctf1-6.txt`

__Explanation 2__

The `find -type` command searches for the type of item listed in the directory. In this case `find -type f` finds and lists all files found in 'technical/government` because the `-type f` searches and lists files. This is relevant in case we are searching for certain files in a directory that are regular files. 

__3. Find -mtime__

__Command 1__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/biomed -mtime -7`

__Output 1__

`technical/biomed

technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-13.txt
technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-16.txt`

__Explanation 1__

The `find -mtime` command searches for files based on when they were last modified. In this case the `-mtime -7` part of the command searches for files that were modified in the last seven days. This is helpful if you are looking for a file you recently modified, or looking for a files you modified a certain number of days ago. 

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/biomed -mtime 0`

__Output 2__
`technical/biomed
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt`

__Explanation 2__

The `find -mtime` command searches for files based on when they were last modified. In this case the `-mtime 0` part of the command searches for files that were modified in the last  day. This is helpful if you are looking for a file you recently modified, or looking for a files you modified a certain number of days ago. 

__4. Find -newermt__

__Command 1__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/government/Post_Rate_comm -newermt "2023-10-01 00:00:00"  ! -newermt "2023-11-03 00:00:00"`

technical/government/Post_Rate_comm/WolakSpeech_usps.txt`

__Explanation 1__

The `-newmt` command finds files modified before a certain date and time. This can be useful if you are looking for files between a time period. 

__Command 2__

T@DESKTOP-84E1182 MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/lab3/docsearch (main)
`$ find technical/ -newermt "2023-11-2 00:00:00"`

__Output 2__

`technical/biomed
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt`

__Explanation 2__
The `-newmt` command finds files modified before a certain date and time. In this case we are looking for files modified before 11/2/23 @12am. This can be useful if you are looking for files between a time period.
